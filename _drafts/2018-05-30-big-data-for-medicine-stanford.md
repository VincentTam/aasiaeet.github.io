I recently attended the Stanford's [Big Data for Precision Health](http://bigdata.stanford.edu) conference and this is a brief overview of interesting things I observed.  I can write in details about every section but I won't since the [recordings]() are available. Instead, I just write matters that sedimented in my memory. 

The first important change to notice was the conference's name change from "Precision Medicine" to "Precision Health" which basically announce that preventing diseases using data is the new focus. Another interesting observation was that many speakers had personal stories which brought them to the field of medicine in first place; suicide of loved onces, genetic disorder of family members, cancer, etc. This is rare in other fields, unless you count "playing Atari game" as a personal story of a game developer! 

# Data Data Data 
Collecting and sharing data was a major theme in the conference. There are new nation-wide initiatives, modern methods and devices to collect data and finally strategies to collect data for rare diseases. Eric Dishman, director of All of Us Research Program, shared his personal touching story with cancer during his keynote. NIH has started enrolling 1 million U.S. participants in All of Us program this May to advance precision medicine. The mission reads as "To accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care for all of us." For all practical purpose, you can consider all of us a largest and richest biomedical resource which will be publicly available for researchers. They want to record as details information as possible from participants: environmental (zip code, water quality, high way proximity, etc.), biological/clinical (genomics, medications, electronic health records, etc.), social (education level, stress, religion, etc.), and behavioral (exercise, eating, drug usage, etc). All of these types of data have been around in different studies, but to me the exiting part is the opportunity to have a whole picture of a person's health and prob the interaction of different factors on the overall well-being. "Project Baseline" was another study with the focus on cancer and cardiovascular diseases which targets enrolling 10000 participants. The idea of project baseline is to track participants detailed info to see when they switch from "health" to "sick" state what exactly changes. 

Sharing back data to engage the participants: undertandable format. When to return (critical)? Scientific challenge: giving back data will convert the observational study to interventional one. 

Electronic health/medical records were another keyword of the conference.
