title: Structured High Dimensional Data Sharing Model
---

\maketitle 
High dimensional structured data sharing model describes groups of
observations by shared and per-group private parameters, each with its
own structure such as sparsity or group sparsity. In this paper we
consider the general form of data sharing where data comes in a fixed
but arbitrary number of groups $G$ and the structure of both shared and
private parameters can be characterized by any norm. $$\begin{aligned}
        \|\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}\|_{2}
        \end{aligned}$$ We propose a simple estimator for high
dimensional data sharing model and provide conditions under which it
consistently estimates both shared and private parameters. We also
characterize sample complexity of the estimator and present high
probability non-asymptotic bound on estimation error of all parameters.
Interestingly the sample complexity of our estimator translates to
conditions on both per-group sample size and total number of samples. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough statistical
analysis of data sharing models despite its recent successful
application.
